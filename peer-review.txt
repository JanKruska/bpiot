3) Public comments for the authors
----------------------------------

This paper gives a good overview of the thory behing embeddings, the implementation of embeddings in Business Process Management and potential use cases for it's application.
To improve the quality of the paper further I have the following comments:

[i] Consider including the hyperref packge for easier navigation to sources and figures, unless technical reason prohibit it's usage

[ii] Eqs.1 & 2: Meaning of "n" is never explained in the text

[iii] Sections 5 and 6 provide various use cases, that could benefit from the usage of embeddings, yet challenges and areas where further work is encessary (bag of words instead of sequence, similarity between model and log embeddings, Could other models/parameters also be or potentially more useful, more attributes for act2vec) are only ever briefly mentioned by themselves.
Including a distinct section about Future work would be helpful to point researchers towards interesting future research questions.
